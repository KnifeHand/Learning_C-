If you take a look at the source code, the class defines an object called Volume. 
 In object oriented programming we can define objects of the same name. However, if 
 you have the class file of the same name located in the same namespace location as the other, you 
 will encounter what is called a "Collision".  By separating the classes in different 
 namespace or package locations we can use the object of the same name and 
 inherit them later if we need them.
