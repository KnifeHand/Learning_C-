If you take a look at the source code, the class defineds an object called Volume. 
 In object oriented programming we can define objects of the same name. However, if 
 you have the class file of the same name located in the same file as the other, you 
 will encounter what is called a "Collision".  By separating the classes in different 
 files we can use the object of the same name and inherit them later if we need them.
